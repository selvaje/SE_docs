Replay to the following questions using a jupyther-notebook, then create a pdf and submit the pdf. If you perform some commands directly in the bash terminal, then use the python-notebook to report the comand in the markdown format.

Create a jupyter-notebook and reply to the following questions by searching and using bash commands:
 
Update and upgrade your virtual machine using command line (we did during the VM installation)
Install gimp ( https://www.gimp.org/) and inkscape ( https://inkscape.org/) via the command line. Reply to the following questions. 
Which is the main difference from the file-format-output between gimp and inkskape (remember the file-format in the GIS environment, it is the same concept)?
Which format you will use to save a very nice image that you can zoom in without losing accuracy (similar to Fig 2 of https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0479-6) 
Search under your home all the files having the extension .tif and count how many there are.
Open in qgis all the .tif files under ~/SE_data/exercise/geodata/LST/ (do not list the file one by one, use regular expressions). 
Open in qgis all the tiff files under ~/SE_data/exercise/geodata/LST/  form February until September (do not list the files one by one, use regular expressions). 
Search the bash command that can generate  20 random numbers between 1 and 100
Search the bash command that can perform mathematical operation e.g 22 / 3 = 7.333333
As the last operation, search the bash command that you can shutdown your virtual machine (be sure to save your work before to run it :-).

All the questions have similar difficulties, therefore will have the same weight in the final grading. For this assignment we are going to use the grading system reported above. This homework is not a collective work, therefore search, search, search on the internet and you will find the solution.

Let’s suppose you want to download 12 files (one for each month) and save each file to a specific folder (e.g. called month1, month2 ….). For this you have to create first empty folders and then perform the download. We will concentrate for now on how to create this empty folder structure without downloading the files (we will do in another occasion). Therefore, with the bash command line create a folder under your home call SE_mydata. Then, under SE_mydata create the folders: month1, month2 …... until month12. Use the right bash command to create the folder SE_mydata and then with the for loop iterate to create the other folders (20%). 
 
Using the file /home/user/SE_data/exercise/txt/aver_month_nuts3_fire.asc, first create the unique list of NUTS ID (see NUTS column), then perform the following task.
 
For each region with identical NUTS ID (see NUTS column) count the number of row (30%)
For each region  with identical NUTS ID (see NUTS column) print the row with the second largest burnet area (see BAREA column) (50%)
For each region with identical NUTS ID (see NUTS column) calculate the sum of the burnet area (BAREA column). For this question you need to use of AWK. It is quite advanced and it will be counted as extra bonus points. +10%
