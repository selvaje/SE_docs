Molecular and medical entomology laboratory,  
Parasitologist and epidemiologist

Babalola Ayodele Samuel is a parasitologist and epidemiologist, with keen interest in modeling of vectors of medical importance and vector -borne diseases . Currently Samuel is working at the Molecular and medical entomology laboratory of the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Lagos where he’s working on ecological niche modelling of Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes in Nigeria. He has a good knowledge of Vector biology, transmission of disease, biostatistics (using various packages such as SPSS, SAS) with a basic understanding of R-Programming language). He is very conversant with the use of ArcGIS software for mapping of infectious diseases.  He also teaches part-time undergraduate courses in zoology and statistics. He bagged his PhD from Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta with a degree in Parasitology.

(5) **Omolola Olojede (Lola)**

Public health official, Intervention coordinator  
Federal Ministry of Health - Nigeria  
Coordination of public health interventions in the country  


With up to 15 years work experience in the onchocerciasis elimination programme, I am involved in
planning and implementing entomological and epidemiological assessments for the elimination of
onchocerciasis in Nigeria. During these years, I was trained on basic ArcGIS and QGIS by the African
Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC).  
Through my training in public health (undergraduate and postgraduate) and on-the-job experience, I
have a good understanding of the importance of modelling for making predictions in health-related
programmes especially as it concerns the elimination of onchocerciasis. My skills amongst others
include excellent use of the computer, both iOS and Windows.
