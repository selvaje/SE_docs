# Shelter locations close to Gioia del Colle (BA)

## Scout Base
In Gioia del Colle there is a [Scout Base](https://goo.gl/maps/HJpXFtpRjprVgR5z9) association with a wooden roof shelter. The shelter is not open but the roof can protect you from the rain. It is in the middle of a urban area but it is very safe. If are lucky you may meet the Scouts and they should let you stay inside their base. Moreover, very close there is a [water fountain](https://goo.gl/maps/CYnaV7aj2KiqARFT9). 

## Protezione Civile Base
Few hundred  meters from the  Scout Base there is [Protezione Civile Base](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F2YjzCwxBhCYkCy69). If are a traveler-solo-girl or you travel with children and you are in trouble you can ask shelter there. I heard bikers that were able to sleep inside. Anyway, let’s try to keep this option only for people that really need, so if are a strong guy do not ask!!

## Abandoned Trulli
Between Gioia and Putignano, at N 40.829804°, E 16.990786° there are some abandoned Trulli (rural  houses in this area) and they are open so you may find a shelter there. You can reach the abandon Trulli following an unpaved road until "Masseria Surico". They are not very clean but if it is raining a lot the trulli are perfect for a dry shelter. 

## Fattoria la Florida
From the Abandoned Trulli you can follow a single-trail + road and arrive to [Fattoria la Florida](https://goo.gl/maps/DLtEBz9cn18zYtPL7). They have very good and fresh mozzarella di Bufala. If you arrive late in the afternoon you may ask to pitch your tend for a night.

## Masseria quercetta
In the same area there is the [Masseria quercetta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5YHUcAjjW3Kdr6rZ9) they have a very good cheese/mozzarella(cow) production and they have a selling point. So it is a must for a stop!! Moreover few hundred meters away the have an [pick nick area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/36yBTFPk5Mp9EAd48) where you can even pitch your tend for one night. Just ask if there is water availability. 

## Pine forest

If are traveling from/to Matera you can camp at [Montursi](https://goo.gl/maps/GBurBGCnCRt63SR98). Yuo will find a pine forest pick nick area with tables and a fountain and plenty of space to pitch your tend. DO NOT START ANY FIRE!! In the evening nobody will be there. On walking distance there is the [Macelleria montursi]( https://goo.gl/maps/ybjP4G11YqYDSGoZ6) where you can buy local meat. They may also grill for you. At 1km there is also a Pizzeria. But check before it may be close in winter.

## Reception network for cyclotourists in Italy 

I have create this [Info network for cyclo-tourists in Italy](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1iWdtq7upqCOzxJWnYR9EBkjhPyovms4&usp=sharing) that list locations useful for Cycloturists. 
Please help me to enrich the map!!

## What to eat
In Puglia you can survive with Focaccia and Mozzarella :-). The focaccia you can find in all bakeries (so call forno, pasticceria, panificio) rather the Mozzarella in the cheese shops (so call caseficio). For example in Gioia go to [Panetteria - Pasticceria Vittorio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mU9MsCQHbUZ2kde28) and get the focaccia then walk few hundred meters to [Arcano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rEXRkF8UZ4GvKJbw9)  get mozzarella keep walking to up to [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t1SmSvA81FDKZrD18) seat and enjoy :-).

Some local grocery/supermarket also have cooked food (e.g. lasagna), so with few euro you can get a real lunch. Also some bakeries make pizza and they are cheaper then pizzeria.

For drinking water there many fountains in the towns a bit less in the rural area (just ask to farmers).

## How to seek for free accommodation 

In general in Puglia there many Masserie (typical farm house) that sell local products: eggs, cheese, mozzarella, milk. I always goes there one hour before is getting dark I buy something i chat a bit and then I ask if i can pitch my tend. Quite often they say of-course and even give you some shelter or offer something to eat. They will not expect money but just be kind and buy some cheese for your travel. Of course they will not speak in english so learn some Italian words 
“posso montare la tenda per una notte?” 

## Use rural roads!!

Always AVOID the road that connect the the town directly, such as:
Giaoi-Noci, Alberobello-Locorotondo, etc. rather always use rural-road. They more beautiful and without cars.
