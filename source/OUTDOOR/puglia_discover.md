# Discover Puglia by bike!


... introduction... Fabienne

## What to expect

This is not the typical organized bike tour you find on the internet. It’s something far more unique—like cycling with a local friend who knows Puglia intimately and wants to show you its hidden, non-touristy treasures. Pedal along peaceful backroads framed by ancient olive groves and dry-stone walls, soaking in the serenity of the countryside. Stop at roadside stands to gather fresh produce, visit family-run caseifici to taste mozzarella and aged cheeses, and enjoy spontaneous picnics in sun-dappled pine forests. Explore historical villages like Alberobello, with its iconic trulli, and Ostuni, the "White City," wandering cobblestone streets rich in history. Indulge in Puglia’s celebrated cuisine, from handmade orecchiette to silky burrata, paired with local wines. Connect with warm-hearted locals eager to share stories, traditions, and their way of life. Camp in the wilderness or stay with community associations, intentionally steering clear of the typical tourist network. Immerse yourself in an authentic, off-the-beaten-path adventure, discovering the true soul of Puglia.
