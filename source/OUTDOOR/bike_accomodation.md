## What to do on the Matera-Gioa-Alberobello routes

### Fattoria la Florida
[Fattoria la Florida](https://goo.gl/maps/DLtEBz9cn18zYtPL7) have very good and fresh mozzarella di Bufala. Mozzarella di Bufala is quite rare so do not loose this opportunity.

### Masseria quercetta
In the same area there is the [Masseria quercetta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5YHUcAjjW3Kdr6rZ9) they have a very good cheese/mozzarella(cow) production and they have a selling point. So it is a must for a stop!! 

### What to eat
In Puglia you can survive with Focaccia and Mozzarella :-). The focaccia you can find in all bakeries (so call forno, pasticceria, panificio) rather the Mozzarella in the cheese shops (so call caseficio). For example in Gioia go to [Panetteria - Pasticceria Vittorio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mU9MsCQHbUZ2kde28) and get the focaccia then walk few hundred meters to [Arcano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rEXRkF8UZ4GvKJbw9)  get mozzarella keep walking to up to [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t1SmSvA81FDKZrD18) seat and enjoy :-).

Some local grocery/supermarket also have cooked food (e.g. lasagna), so with few euro you can get a real lunch. Also some bakeries make pizza and they are cheaper then pizzeria.

For drinking water there many fountains in the towns a bit less in the rural area (just ask to farmers).


### Use rural roads!!

Always AVOID the road that connect the the town directly, such as:
Giaoi-Noci, Alberobello-Locorotondo, etc. rather always use rural-road. They more beautiful and without cars.
