**In-Person Coding Hackathon week: November 24-28 2025, Matera, Italy**

The in-person Matera session can be considered a sort of hackathon where participants will work on their code from 9am to 5pm and on the last days will present their final project and code. This week aims to achieve group collaboration and troubleshooting under the direct supervision of the trainers. During this session, there will also be brief talks from the trainers and from invited speakers.


**Course objectives**

In this course, students will be introduced to an array of powerful open-source geocomputation tools and machine learning methodologies under Linux environment. Students who have never been exposed to programming under Linux are expected to reach the stage where they feel confident in using very advanced open source data processing routines. Students with a precedent programming background will find the course beneficial in enhancing their programming skills for better modelling and coding proficiency. Our dual teaching aim is to equip attendees with powerful tools as well as rendering their abilities of continuing independent development afterwards. The acquired skills will be beneficial, not only for GIS related application, but also for general data processing and applied statistical computing in a number of fields. These essentially lay the foundation for career development as a data scientist in the geographic domain.

**All the class will be recorded. The video link will be posted in the syllabus below**

## Lecture 3: Tuesday, 22 September, 2025.
### Discovering the power of AWK programming language (Giuseppe Amatulli).

Recorded lecture can be found [here](https://yale.zoom.us/rec/share/d1YHiGdeet_g_QKMq9yaisXBrh0bqIT2FCxGcynrVTZ73Z7z4uqSsbD6viAvN2VY.Nfm5tzUERASw8Paq).

Transcript summary lecture can found [here](http://spatial-ecology.net/docs/source/COURSESAROUNDTHEWORLD/course_geocomp_ml_09-11_2025_resume/lect03_GML_23092025.pdf).

This session is fundamental for data filtering and preparation, bulk data download, text files manipulation, descriptive statistics and basic mathematical operation on large files. Students will access, query, understand and clean up data, perform data filtering using bash command line. We use AWK which is an extremely versatile and powerful programming language for working on text files, performing data extraction and reporting or to squeeze data before importing them into R/python or other software types.


* [Welcome to AWK world](http://spatial-ecology.net/docs/build/html/AWK/awk.html). Why to use AWK command line (Lecture).
* The basic commands, command syntax  (Hands on tutorial).
	* Built in variables
	* Import variables
	* String functions
	* Numerical functions
	* Query functions
	* Manipulate large files before importing in R
	* A study case: Manipulate thousand of text file with BASH and AWK
	* This session summarizes the use of BASH and AWK with a practical example of text file manipulation.


* [Explain GSIM text files](http://spatial-ecology.net/docs/build/html/CASESTUDY/manipulate_GSIM.html) (Listen to the recorded video lecture and proceed with self-learning mode.)
	* Data exploration (Hands on tutorial).
	* Count number of observations
	* Count how many observations per date
	* Monthly MEAN distribution
	
**Suggested assignments:**

Please send the jupyter file or sh file (name as name\_surname.ipynb or name\_surname.sh ) as e-mail attachment  to g.amatulli@spatial-ecology.net.

Using the bash (and/or awk) language manipulate the GSIM/US*.mon files in order to create txt files, one for each month-year, that includes the station ID, latitude, longitude and the MEAN value.
 
The final output will be n text files (form *FirstDateOfTheSeries* to LastDateOfTheSeries) with the following structure: 


    cat 2002-01.txt 

 Gsim.no     latitude    longitude   MEAN   
 US_0001971	33.79427255 -84.4743747 0.916785714285714  
 US_0001977	33.65666667 -84.6736111 74.5558064516129  

In case you wanna manipulate your own txt (or csv) files, fell free to do it by implementing everything in bash (and/or awk). 
You can perform:
- data summary 
- table re-organization    
- data filtering
